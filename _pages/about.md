I am an **Assistant Professor** at the *School of Business Administration, Chung-Ang University*. My research focuses on FinTech analysis, including AI for Finance and Blockchain Economics. 
Specifically, I study quantitative risk measurement of financial assets by incorporating their interconnected structures, and I leverage these insights to enhance portfolio performance. I am also actively investigating the impact of stablecoins on the macroeconomy and the broader blockchain ecosystem.


Before joining *Chung-Ang University*, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at the *Institute of Engineering Research, Seoul National University*. I received a Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering from the *Seoul National University*. Prior to that, I received a B.S. in Industrial Engineering and a B.A. in Economics from *Seoul National University*.
